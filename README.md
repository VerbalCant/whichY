# whichY

`whichY` is an advanced Y-DNA haplotyper leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and Bayesian inference to deliver highly accurate and precise haplogroup classifications for human Y-DNA. Designed for both bioinformatics professionals and genetic genealogists, it integrates cutting-edge genomic pipelines with probabilistic modeling to infer Y-haplogroups based on minimal sequence input. 

By combining multi-layered convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a custom-trained recurrent Bayesian network, `whichY` dynamically predicts Y-DNA haplogroups, even for samples with low coverage or degraded quality, such as ancient DNA. Our hybrid deep learning architecture is powered by the latest in data augmentation and transfer learning techniques, allowing it to surpass traditional rule-based methods in both speed and accuracy.

`whichY`â€™s algorithm adapts in real-time, drawing from an ever-growing database of global Y-DNA reference sequences, and employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to optimize haplotype likelihoods. The result is a streamlined pipeline capable of phasing and imputing SNP data across populations, providing users with robust ancestry insights grounded in the latest population genetics research.

## Input Data

whichY accepts Y-DNA sequences in the following formats:
- **FASTA**: A text-based format for representing nucleotide sequences.
- **VCF**: Variant Call Format, used for storing gene sequence variations.
- **BAM**: Binary Alignment Map, used for storing aligned sequence data.

Ensure your input data is aligned to one of the supported reference genomes: hg38, CHM13, or hg19.

### Example Input

### Example Command Line

To run whichY with a sample input file in FASTA format, use the following command:

```bash
whichY -i sample_input.fasta -a alignment_file -f fasta
```

## Output

The primary output of whichY is the identified paternal lineage along with a confidence score, which is printed to the console. Future versions may include options for more detailed reports and visualizations.
